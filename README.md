# Summer 2020 Internships

A repository to collect data about internship postings for Summer 2020 for students in software engineering, tech, computer science, etc! 

There's plenty of other lists that are maintained but I thought I would start one that caters to Canadian students as well (Or for those looking to come work in Canada ðŸ˜Ž).

I try to keep this up to date both for my own search and to help others but please feel free to contribute!

#### To contribute:

Check out these other great repos too :)
